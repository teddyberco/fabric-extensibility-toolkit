# Project Structure

This document explains the structure of this repository and which files are used or created automatically. We have tried to create a structure that is easy to understand but also flexible for a DevOps approach. This is the reason why configuration files are used to allow the repository to be used to create different environments (e.g. Dev, Test and Prod). The Scripts in this repository rely on the structure changing it could also mean that you have to adopt the scripts. Our suggestion is to use the structure as it is as this will also enable you to get updates from us in the future.

```

## 🚀 Workflow

### 1. Initial Project Setup (Once per project)

Every project normally only needs to be set up once at the beginning. All necessary files are created for a complete DevOps integration.

```powershell
.\scripts\Setup\SetupWorkload.ps1
```

- Prompts for workload name and frontend app ID
- Generates .env.dev, .env.test, .env.prod files
- These files are committed to the repository
- No shared config files needed after this

### 2. Developer Environment Setup (Each developer)

```powershell
.\scripts\Setup\SetupDevEnvironment.ps1
```

- Reads configuration from .env.dev
- Prompts for developer's workspace GUID
- Generates local DevGateway configuration
- No dependency on shared config files

### 3. Daily Development

```powershell
# Start development
.\scripts\Run\StartDevServer.ps1     # Uses .env.dev 
.\scripts\Run\StartDevGateway.ps1    # Uses generated DevGateway config
```

### 4. Build and Deployment

```powershell
# Build frontend application
.\scripts\Build\BuildFrontend.ps1 -Environment dev

# Build manifest package - this is done automatically every time the DevGateway is started or the DevServer gets a request to provide the manifest
.\scripts\Build\BuildManifestPackage.ps1 -Environment prod

# Complete build for deployment
.\scripts\Build\BuildAll.ps1 -Environment prod
```

All build outputs are generated in the `build/` directory and are environment-specific based on the corresponding `.env.*` file.

## 🏗️ Build Architecture

### On-Demand Generation

All build artifacts are generated on-demand from source templates and configuration:

- **Frontend Build**: Application code compiled and bundled for deployment
- **DevGateway Config**: Generated configuration based on environment variables and workspace settings
- **Manifest Package**: NuGet package created from templates with environment-specific variable replacement
- **No Static Config**: No pre-generated configuration files are stored in the repository

### Environment-Specific Builds

Each build target uses the appropriate `.env.*` file:

- **Development**: Uses `.env.dev` → `build/` outputs for local testing
- **Test/Staging**: Uses `.env.test` → `build/` outputs for staging deployment  
- **Production**: Uses `.env.prod` → `build/` outputs for production deployment

### Build Dependencies

- **Source**: `Workload/app/` and `Workload/Manifest/` templates
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific `.env.*` files
- **Output**: Complete deployment artifacts in `build/` directory

## 📁 Configuration Management

### What Gets Committed

- ✅ `Workload/.env.dev` - All team members use this for development
- ✅ `Workload/.env.test` - Staging environment configuration
- ✅ `Workload/.env.prod` - Production environment configuration
- ✅ `Workload/.env.template` - Setup template for project initialization
- ✅ `Workload/Manifest/` - All manifest templates and item configurations
- ✅ `Workload/app/` - Application source code

## 📦 Item Management

### Per-Item Configuration

Each Fabric item has its own folder containing:

- **Item Definition**: JSON/XML files required by Microsoft Fabric

### Item Structure Example

```text
Workload/Manifest/items/HelloWorld/
├── HelloWorldItem.json          # Fabric JSON configuration
└── HelloWorldItem.xml           # Fabric XML template with placeholders (e.g., {{WORKLOAD_NAME}})
```

### Template Processing and Environment Management

The configuration system uses template processing for environment-specific manifests:

- **XML Templates**: Item XML files contain placeholders like `{{WORKLOAD_NAME}}` that are replaced during manifest generation
- **Environment-Specific Generation**: Placeholders are replaced with values from the appropriate .env file (dev/test/prod)
- **Build-Time Processing**: Manifest generation reads environment variables and processes all template files
- **Example**: `{{WORKLOAD_NAME}}` becomes the actual workload name from `.env.dev` when building development manifests

### General Workload Configuration

The workload has general configuration files:

- **Product.json**: Workload metadata, display names, descriptions, and general settings
- **WorkloadManifest.xml**: Main workload manifest with authentication and service configuration (also uses placeholders)
- ***.xsd**: Schema definition files for validation

### Schema and Structure Management

- **Naming Convention**: Item files follow [ItemName]Item naming pattern (e.g., HelloWorldItem.json, HelloWorldItem.xml)
- **Template Files**: XML files use placeholders that are replaced during manifest generation
- **Version Control**: All ItemDefinition contents are committed for team sharing
- **Validation**: Each item maintains its own validation rules and documentation

### What Stays Local (Generated on Build)

- ❌ `build/Frontend/` - Built frontend application ready for deployment
- ❌ `build/DevGateway/` - Generated DevGateway configuration and runtime files
- ❌ `build/Manifest/` - Processed manifest files and NuGet packages
- ❌ `build/Manifest/[WorkloadName].[Version].nupkg` - Final deployment package

All files in the `build/` directory are generated on-demand from templates and should not be committed to version control.

### Configuration Changes

- **Environment settings**: Edit .env files directly and commit
- **New environments**: Copy existing .env file, modify, and commit
- **Item configurations**: Add/modify files in Workload/Manifest/items/[ItemName]/ and commit
- **Developer workspace**: Run SetupDevEnvironment.ps1 again
- **Build artifacts**: Run build scripts to regenerate all files in build/ directory

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Self-Contained**: All configuration lives with the application code
2. **Standard Format**: .env files are universally understood
3. **Simple Workflow**: Two setup steps, then normal development
4. **No Dependencies**: After setup, no external config files needed
5. **Environment Clarity**: Each deployment target has its own committed file
6. **Direct Editing**: Developers can modify .env files without complex scripts
